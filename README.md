# Ai-vs.-Human-Text-Classifier-LSTM
This project builds an AI vs Human Text Classifier using LSTM to tell the difference between text written by humans and AI. Using NLP techniques, the model learns to classify text into two categories: human or AI-generated, showcasing how deep learning can help us spot machine-created content in a natural way.
